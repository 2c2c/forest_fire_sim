ascii forest fire simulation in raw elixir(no genserver)

* A forest with initial fire points randomly generated
* Fire spreads to adjacent trees on the next tick
* Each fire lasts 4 ticks
* Each fire is its own process
* A world process renders the current state of forest to the screen

This was an exercise from an elixirconf presentation
